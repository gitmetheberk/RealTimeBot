# RealTimeBot
Have you ever been in a Discord server with friends in different timezones?
<br>
Have you ever dealt with one of these friends who always demands you convert everything to "real time" every time that time is mentioned, and that you do so in a timely fashion?
<br>
Deal with this friend no longer using RealTimeBot, a bot built solely to shut up that one friend.

A Discord bot built on Discord.py
